<h1>	BIO ABOUT ME</h1>
<p>	Hi, My name is Gino Webb and I am a current student and temporaily inactive football player at erskine college. I am 20 years old, I have 1 Dog, and I am originally from Georgia, and I believe I'm easy to talk too most of the times.</p>
<br>	I would like to become a programmer when I get older nd out of college to one day create my very own video game. Ever since COV-ID 19 I've wanted to know more about technology since I was inside 24/7.
